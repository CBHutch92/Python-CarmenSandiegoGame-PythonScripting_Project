# About the "Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego" Game project

# The code for this project was written by me as part of the course work for my Python Scripting for Data Science course (ITEC 3100). This was the final project for this course, and the project was designed to require us to use many of things we covered throughout the course.

# The attached .txt file is not required to run the program, as it is written to create the file if it does not already exist, but it is useable if you want to start with high scores available.

# I chose to use sports related facts about each location in the game, so if you are not a sports fan this may be a touch more difficult!

# The comments throughout the code were for my professor and to highlight each step we were required to cover on our assignment sheet.

# I received an A for this project.
